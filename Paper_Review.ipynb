        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this paper, the author proposed a new generative model estimation procedure in order to solve the main problem of generative models, which is the difficulty of approximating many intractable probabilistic computations that arise in maximum likelihood estimation and related strategies, and the difficulty of leveraging the benefits of piece-wise linear units in the generative context[1]. So that generative models may have more impact.\n",
        "The Generative Adversarial Nets proposed by the author basically have two parts, a discriminative model that learns to determine whether a sample is from the model distribution or the data distribution, which means, to tell whether the data it receive is a “real” data; and a generative model that produces “fake” data with a random noise and try to use it without detected by the discriminative model. The training procedure is done when the generative model can generate almost real data that can’t be distinguished by the discriminative model.\n",
        "In the Generative Adversarial Nets, we can train both two models using only the backpropagation, as well as the dropout algorithms [2] to avoid over-fitting. Approximate inference or Markov chains are not needed in this generative net, so that the computational cost is greatly reduced.\n",

        "## 2. Content\n",
        "\n",
        "### > Related Works\n",
        "\n",
        "In the first section of this paper numbers of related works are reviewed . First of all,  author presented the main problem of undirected graphical models with latent variables(eg.RBMs and DBMs), which quantity as well as gradient estimation are mostly rely on the Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, while mixing poses can cause much trouble for this method. \n",
        "Also, DBNs, representing hybrid models which involve a single undirected layer and several directed layers, always encounter computational difficulties .\n",
        "There are also other criteria like score matching and NCE to avoid the computational problem, but these criteria need learned probability density analyzed into a normalization constant. However in numbers of generative models, we can’t even acquire a tractable unnormalized probability density.\n",
        "At last, the adversarial nets have a better performance of backpropagation comparing to techniques without defining a probability distribution explicitly eg. GSN framework, while it may have problems with unbounded activation when used in a feedback loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "### > Explaining Adversarial Nets\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, the author uses figures and some simple formulas to explain what is adversarial nets doing and how it is accomplishing the mission that train the generative model as well as updating the discriminative model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### > Theoretical Results\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, the author presents a theoretical analysis of adversarial nets, analyzing this method in a mathematical way how the training procedure allows one to recover the data generating distribution as the generator and the discriminator are given enough capacity. \n",
        "Using mathematical formulas to proof that this adversarial game between the generative model and the discriminative model has a global optimum for pg = pdata, which means that the distribution of generated data and real data is completely the same, thus achieving the desired result.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### > Experiments\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, the author trained the adversarial nets using a wide range of data including MNIST,TFD and CIFAR-10. Then the author used Parzen window-based log-likelihood estimates and evaluate the performance of adversarial nets by comparing it to other generative models. Then in this paper, the author also tried to visualize samples from the model. As a result, we can see that although it is not performing better than all those existing methods, it’s performance has convinced us that it is at least a very powerful competitor. Besides, as the adversarial nets have just be introduced, it still have much potential and can be considered as one of the most promising methods for unsupervised learning in complex distribution in recent years. \n",
        "\n",
        "### > Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, the author talks about both advantages and disadvantages of this newly introduced framework.\n",
        "One of the disadvantage is that we have to make sure that the training procedure of generator G and discriminator D are trained at the same pace, otherwise it is very likely to encounter a “the Helvetica scenario”, which means that it will have a very pool ability dealing with diversity data and will finally leads to a mode collapses.\n",
        "There are also advantages of this framework, one of it is that there is no need for a Markov chain, so that it is not computationally costly, it will have a lower training difficulty with a higher training efficiency and it can contain numbers of different functions. Also, statistically, it has the advantage that updated directly with data examples, but with the gradient, which will increase diversity of generated samples.Besides, the adversarial nets can finally generate very sharp distributions, which means that the samples generated by this framework will be more easier for people to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### > Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, the author talked about the overall situation of the adversarial nets, and its possible future extensions.\n",
        "1.Firstly the generation procedure of GAN doesn’t require complicated operations such as sampling sequence, which means that it can adopt a new data C and start to sample and infer directly.\n",
        "2.Learned approximate inference can be performed by training an auxiliary net . With the advantage of it , the inference net may be trained for a fixed generator net after the generator net has finished training.\n",
        "3.One can approximate much wider conditionals using a family of conditional models that share parameters.\n",
        "4. Also this framework can be further used in semi-supervised learning, because the training procedure of generative adversarial nets doesn’t require data to be labeled. \n",
        "5.Besides, its training can be faster if the method for G and D is improved or it has a better sample distribution.\n",

        "## 3. Innovation\n",
        "\n",
        "This paper has presented us the generative adversarial model, which is a new generative model using a new method. It is presented to solve the major problem of current existing generative models, for example, computationally complicated ,low efficiency and low accuracy in most cases. \n",
        "GAN, which has been presented by this paper, is definitely have a great impact to the development of generative models. As a generative method, GAN effectively solves the problem of generating data that can be interpreted naturally. Especially in the case of generating high-dimensional data, the neural network that has adopted by this model does not restrict the dimension of generation, which greatly broadens the scope of generating data samples that it can deal with. Besides, the structure of the model can integrate all kinds of loss functions and increase the degree of freedom of design. Also, GAN training process innovatively takes the adversarial of two models as training criteria and can be trained by only using the highly successful back propagation and dropout algorithms. The training process of the model does not require a Markov chain, which is computationally costly with a lower efficiency, nor does it need any unrolled approximate inference network, all these improvements will greatly reduce the training difficulty and enhance the training efficiency of generative models.\n",
        "What’s more, the generation of GAN does not need complicated sampling sequence. Which means that it can adopt sample and infer new samples directly, which improves the productivity of new samples. The adversarial model training method not being updated directly with data examples, but with the gradient that flows through the discriminator, thus increasing the diversity of generated samples. It doesn’t require a label, which has made it suitable for further usage in semi-supervised learning. At last, the model generated are mostly sharp distributions, which means that the samples generated by this framework will be more easier for people to understand.\n",

        "## 4. Technical Quality\n",
        "\n",
        "The overall technical quality is not bad, since this paper is only aiming to introduce a new method of building a generative model, its technical quality is reasonably acceptable.\n",
        "Firstly as a technical report, the structure of the paper is good and can lead readers go deep into the topic that the author is trying to introduce.\n",
        "Secondly, as it is using a new method, the author need to let readers understand how this method is building a reliable model, how the whole training procedure is done. The author analogizing the generative model to a team of counterfeiters,and the discriminative model to the police is a very good way for explaining a newly introduced method to readers who have never heard of it before.\n",
        "Then the author clearly explain how the training procedure is building a generative model that can be used in practical using figures and mathematical deduction and proof. The theoretical proving procedure is clear enough and welly structured, so that it can be easily understand by the readers, which is making it a good technical report.\n",
        "As a new way of modeling generative model, the experiments of the model’s performance is acceptable that it is tested on 3 well-known dataset, which is MNIST(Hand written numbers), the Toronto Face Database(Human face) and CIFAR-10(A dataset with 60000 images, widely used in testing deep learning networks), it is using widely used datasets, so the result of its experiment is reasonably reliable. However, for a mature deep learning network, the experiment amount is somehow too small, the author should use more and larger images for testing(eg. ImageNet), and non-image test dataset as well.So that it can provide a more convincing result or present more insight problems that remains to be solved.\n",
        "The advantages of the generative adversarial network is addressed good, the author concluded both computational and statistical advantages. As for the disadvantages, the author only mentioned the difficulty in maintaining the generator G and the discriminator D being trained and updated at the same pace, which is in another word, the training procedure has to be stable and balanced,or the model is very likely to collapse. \n",
        "However, the problems remain to be solved is definitely more than what the author has provided, for example,\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Original GAN can’t provide a value like cross-entropy or accuracy that can be used to indicate the training process.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   GAN has a poor performance on non-image data,such as , texts and structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.   It has been proved that the convergence state of GAN may not exist when the number of parameters is limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be seen from the problems listed as above that GAN still have some critical problems remain to be solved, however it is not mentioned by the author. Also, the author didn’t mention how to do the future work in order to fix the current existing problems, not even the problem on stabilizing the training procedure.\n",
        "What’s more, I think as a new model, the author should think what kind of situation will GAN be aiming to solve, why it is better than other methods. When people facing with a new concept, the normal question they will ask is “How it is different?”. As a technical report, introducing a new technical method, the author should also think about, at least theoretically, in which field it can do better than other methods. \n",
        "So as far as I consider, the technical quality is not bad, the introduction about the model is clear and the explanation of the model can be easily understand. But on the other hand, it need to lay more emphasize on the experiment part, since the testing dataset is not large enough even in the field of image discriminating, so the result is not that convincing. Also, it need to find out more remaining problems on the model, and explain how they will try to deal with those problems in their future works, but not only laying stress on their advantages, this is a technical report not promoting products anyway.\n",

        "## 5. Application and X-factor\n",
        "\n",
        "The possible application domain is not mentioned in this paper, however , there are several domains that GAN can effectively be used in.\n",
        "It is now being mainly used in the field of image generation and have some great success. For example, GAN can increasing image resolution, which is also called: Super-resolution(SR), it is to generate high resolution photos from lower resolution photos. GAN can use its SR ability in astronomical and satellite images, which very helpful in astronomy, military and other fields. It can also be used in image inpainting, which is to restore the complete image according to a incomplete image. Moreover, we can use to GAN to realize Text-to-image, for example, if we input a sentence, we can generate multiple images that match the description. What’s more, GAN is also boosting the development of face recognizing, because if we have a single input image of a human’s face, we can then use GAN to generate that face from different perspectives, which will enhance the accuracy of recognition .\n",
        "For the domain that it can be used in future, one important part is the medical domain. We can use this to generate the cure for a certain disease. Using GAN, we can train generators to operate as accurately as possible on existing medicines from a drug database on a disease-by-disease basis. After training, a generator can be used to obtain a prescription for a certain disease, and a discriminator can be used to determine whether the generated prescription has cured a specific disease, and if the training capacity is big enough, we will then have a perfect prescription solution. Which means that the possibility of misdiagnose and the time requirement of seeing a doctor will be greatly reduced. Besides, it may also somehow, generate a prescription for a previously incurable disease. \n",
        "What I found GAN is interesting about is the way of training it, which is the idea of adversarial, it means that it doesn’t require a huge training data as other models do. What we want from machine learning and artificial intelligence is always we human do less work, while computer will do more, so far as I’m concerned, GAN is surely a good idea to start with. Maybe the origin GAN in this paper isn’t performing that good, but with the deepening of research, I believe the model developed based GAN will be able to cope with more and more situations.\n",
        "Unsupervised learning is our next important goal of artificial intelligence, we are looking forward to use little labeled data and also can achieve a satisfying result at the same time. As new way of training a generative model, GAN is definitely creative and exciting, because it is based on Semi-supervised learning: use limited labeled data as input, the let the generator and discriminator confront each other then constantly improve themselves. So it may not be the best model in machine learning so far, but the idea of training a model will surely help us to build a better future of machine learning. \n",

        "## 6. Presentation \n",
        "\n",
        "The quality of the presentation of the paper is good, is successfully introduced a brand new generative model to the reader. As a new model, it clearly guide our readers through the whole model, including, what does the model contains, how it is trained and how the training procedure is proved to be working. Since it is a new concept to our readers, the reader use metaphors to help us understand what GAN is actually doing, which is very good way of presentation from my point of view. Also, the structure of the mathematical proof is solid, so that it can be easily understood by the reader. It is very easy for our readers to follow the argument in this paper on the whole.\n",
        "However, the depth of the argument can be a little more deepen, the author should lay more emphasize on both the advantages and disadvantages of GAN, so that we can have a better understanding of the model, it can also help us to make further improvements on the model so that it can deal with more situations. Also, the author should tell us more about their future work on the model and possible future application domain, thus letting us readers understand why GAN is different from other models, how it can be further improved and what kind of problems it might can help us to solve in the future.\n",
        "There are several points that this paper can improve, but as introducing a new model, it is understandable that the author didn’t think much about it’s future domain or improvements, and this paper is easy for our readers to follow indeed. So to sum up, I think the presentation is reasonably pretty good and can be considered as a good technical report. \n",
